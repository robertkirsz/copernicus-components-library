# Copernicus Components Library

##### Installation

* `npm install`

##### Development

* `npm start` - it will launch the demo site, which can be used to develop components. The code will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

##### Build demo page

* `npm run build` - this will create a demo page that showcases our components (the same that you get with `npm start`). It will be outputted to the `dist` folder, which can then be viewed as a static website.

The build system for the demo page is based on https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter, so go there if you need more info.
